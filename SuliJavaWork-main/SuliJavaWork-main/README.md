## Fundamentals Of OOP
1. programming paradigm- different styles of programming.
2. In procedural programming everything is variable, constant & subroutine is defined seperately with no relationship, in OOP they define objects with their own values, subroutines making the able to be grouped together in a logical way
3. Object is one instance of a class. Class is a data type which is a blueprint for the objects.
4. when a pin class wants to count the number of existing pin objects.


## Encapsulation
1. Encapsulation - grouping data & subroutines to make program easier to work on and understand.
2. public method can be used by other classes while private method can only be called in its own class
3. Attribute could be made private for security reasons.
4. Accessor (getters) - method returning value of a private attribute. Mutator (setters) - method altering value of a private attribute.
5. mutators used to change functionality of a class. Accessors- get the private method
6. easier to access objects as classes arent needed to be created.


## Inheritance & Abstract Methods
1. When one class copies copies the characteristics of anther class but then adds onto or alters it's attributes.

3a. parent-Guitar  Child Electric Guitar
3b. inherits holdFret & strum
4. it runs consructor method of it's parent class
5. when multiple inheritance happens, issues regarding what characteristics that class should inherit can happen.
6. abstract method- a method defining only it's name and parameters.They tell the programmer what functionality a class needs to implement without defining a generic method in the parent class that may not be useful. You may use an abstract method when the child classes are going to replace them anyway.

## Polymorphism
1. Polymorphism - allowing multiple methods to be implemented differently using the same name. It can make it so a child class can change a method from the parent class.
2.  Because it is the parent class, so onl number can overwrite Object.
3.  'public procedure type(). because it changed the print from object to number.
4. 'public function add'. because another method was added to it. 'num3'
5. 'public procedure new()' is a virtual method because it can be overwritten and overloaded.
6. so i can change it.
