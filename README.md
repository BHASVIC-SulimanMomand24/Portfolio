Suliman's Portfolio

My name is Suliman Momand. I am a BHASVIC Student. I am currently about to start my 2nd year of 6th form. I do A level computer science, physics and maths

My goals for the future is to become either a mechanical or software engineer. Or to be an accountant.

Right now i am working on a 2d platformer mining game for my programming project. In my game you will be in a mine where you will have to mine a certain amount of ores and then escape without dying. It will include many different fun things to make the game feel exciting to play

I am great at teamwork- I have done a couple of projects with peers so far in college and i have communicated will with them.

I am a good problem solver- I like to solve problems, especially while i code.
