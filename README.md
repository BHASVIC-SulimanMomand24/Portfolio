Suliman's Portfolio

My name is Suliman Momand. I am a BHASVIC Student. I am currently about to start my 2nd year of 6th form. I do A level computer science, physics and maths

I am a big fan of technology. My goals for the future is to become either a mechanical or software engineer. Or to be an accountant.

Right now i am working on a 2d platformer mining game for my programming project. In my game you will be in a mine where you will have to mine a certain amount of ores and then escape without dying. I have oinly started the analysis stage so far but i will make sure that my game will have many fun elements to it

I am great at teamwork- I have collaborated with peers on a couple projects so far in college and i have communicated very well with nthem to achicve our combined goals.
I am a good problem solver- I enjoy tackling challenges, especially while i code.
